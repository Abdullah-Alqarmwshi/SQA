 STEP 1: FIX MYSQL ERROR


Your XAMPP is showing "MySQL shutdown unexpectedly" error. Here are two solutions:

METHOD 1: Change MySQL Port (Quick Fix)
─
1. Open XAMPP Control Panel
2. Click "Config" button next to MySQL module
3. Select "my.ini" from the dropdown
4. Find this line (appears TWICE in the file):
   port=3306
5. Change BOTH instances to:
   port=3307
6. Save the file and close
7. Click "Start" on MySQL in XAMPP Control Panel

 IMPORTANT: If you use Method 1, you must also update the port in:
   C:\xampp\htdocs\mywebsite\config\database.php
   Change: define('DB_PORT', '3306');
   To:     define('DB_PORT', '3307');


METHOD 2: Complete MySQL Reset (If Method 1 fails)

1. Stop all XAMPP services
2. Navigate to: C:\xampp\mysql
3. Find the "data" folder
4. Rename "data" to "data_old" (backup)
5. Copy the "backup" folder
